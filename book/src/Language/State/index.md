# State

Some choices don't have consequences which change the entire course of the story - they could just change dialogue options, interactions between characters, or possibly what happens in a certain path. We can use **state** for this with **javascript**. [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a scripting language originally meant for the web, but these days it's used everywhere! 
Don't worry, you don't need to know javascript to add state to your story.

Javascript can be used inline, placed between curly brackets `{}`, or as a block with 3 backticks:

````
{"This is inline javascript"}

```
"This is block javascript"
```
````
