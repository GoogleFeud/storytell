# Storytell

Storytell is a text editor which allows you to write interactive fiction - from scripts with simple choices to massive stories with many branching storylines and endings. It also allows you to **play** your story as you write it, and view how your stories branches. Create scripts for games and other interactive media with ease!

This app takes huge inspiration from the [inky](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) language and editor. It tries to make the writing process a lot simpler and easier, with less special characters to remember, while still providing all the power inky has.

It also provides you with useful tools which inky is missing, such as:

- A branch viewer which allows you to view where each path leads you.
- Useful statistics such as permutations, dead ends, most common paths, etc.
